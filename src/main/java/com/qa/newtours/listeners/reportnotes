thread local concept 
is responsible to execute test cases in parallel mode with different browsers 
lets say we have multiple test cases and every test case is executing with different browser 
in that case we dont know what test case running in which thread 


so what happens if we are applying any kind a listener in our framework 
like testng report, allure report, pdf report, tesult report listener 

if we dont use thread local concept 
it might disturb our framework 
because we running in parrallel mode multiple test cases few browsers 
and at  the end any havy report tool might confuse then it will override report to another test which 
is executed but it marked as failed or vice versa 
for example lets say there two test cases one is passed another is failed 
but in the report is says both is failed why because it takes latest report this kind a issues is quite 
common in parallel execution 
so to solve this proble we are using thread local concept with the help of the java 

in framework its better to apply thread local driver in base page so everytime to call

when we are applying tld driver we have to apply first set then get method 
note: its not a getter and setter 
get will give you driver 
set will set it 

along with that when we are applying to the get method in tldriver
we are providing with synchronization so its responsible 
lets say whenever any thread using specific driver it wont disturb another thread 


and we are running our test cases with different thread
